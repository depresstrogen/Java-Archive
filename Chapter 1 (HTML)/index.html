			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Hello, my name is Riley Power! I live in Brampton Ontario and go to St Thomas Aquinas School. I enjoy to play computer games like counter strike.</p>
		<p>My mom's name is Allison and my dad's name is Michael. I have a brother in Carleton University named Cody. My brother does not live with us as the university is too long of a drive, so i live with both my parents. My mom is 40 and my dad is 43 years old.</p>
		<p>I have enjoy going to value village. I currently have over 10 game consoles purchaced there for about $10 each. I have built my own computer which is leagues better than the school computers. I also achieved honour roll last year.</p>
